# Nina Improved
A modification of the [Nina](https://archive.org/details/NinaPaleyFonts) font family with added glyphs

## Why fork Nina?
I was using the original Nina font for my [Mimi and Eunice transcripts](https://github.com/TheOpenSourceNinja/Mimi-and-Eunice-transcripts) and [Markov Comic Generator](https://github.com/TheOpenSourceNinja/Markov-Comic-Generator) projects, and I found it to be lacking a few symbols.

## What improvements will be made?
* So far, I'm only planning on adding the small number of glyphs which are used in Nina Paley's Mimi and Eunice [comics](https://mimiandeunice.com/) (and thus my Mimi and Eunice transcripts) and are not already present in the existing fonts.
* I am also attempting to correct any errors that FontForge points out, hopefully resulting in a more generally usable font.

## Tools used
* [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/)
* [The GNU Image Manipulation Program](https://www.gimp.org/)
